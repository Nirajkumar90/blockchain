# Crowdfunding Smart Contract

## Vision

The **Crowdfunding** smart contract enables decentralized funding of projects, allowing contributors to support initiatives by transferring funds directly to project creators. This contract tracks the total funds raised and ensures that funds are released only when milestones are met, promoting transparency and accountability.

## Features

- **Contribute to Projects**:
  - Contributors can fund projects, with their contributions tracked and added to the total project funds.
- **Release Funds**:
  - Project creators can receive funds once specific milestones are reached, ensuring funds are used as intended.

## Future Scope

1. **Milestone Verification**:

   - Implement a decentralized milestone verification process to ensure milestones are met before releasing funds.

2. **Refund Mechanism**:

   - Add functionality to allow contributors to request refunds if project milestones are not achieved.

3. **Multi-Project Support**:
   - Enable creators to manage multiple projects with different funding goals and milestones.

The **Crowdfunding** contract provides a secure and transparent platform for decentralized project funding, ensuring accountability for both contributors and project creators.
